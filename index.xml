      <description>Ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve start my career in software engineering, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been obsessed with one question in mind &amp;mdash; what can go wrong?

ðŸ’­ What can go wrong with this framework I am using?
ðŸ’­ What happens when something &amp;ldquo;goes wrong&amp;rdquo;? Do I have a fallback mechanism? Kill switch?

This deserves its own blog post, but in short a software engineer must know what language, features of a language, framework, and tool is the best to solve your problem.</description>
