      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently completed my first year as an engineering manager - specifically on the Site Reliability team for CloudVision as a Service at Arista.
In many ways I&amp;rsquo;m writing this for myself moreso than anything else - a way to reflect on this year that flew by so quickly, to catalogue what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, to look ahead into next year. I also hope this helps anyone that is considering to step into management, not as a way to discourage, but rather to encourage by sharing lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned this year.</description>

      <description>(In this article I use the term &amp;ldquo;management&amp;rdquo; loosely to refer to any layer of management, not just managers.)
As a software engineer one of the most critical skillset is being able to discern which tool is the right one for the job that needs to be done. This deserves its own blog post, but in short a software engineer must know what language, features of a language, framework, and tool is the best to solve your problem.</description>
