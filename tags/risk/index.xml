      <description>Ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve start my career in software engineering, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been obsessed with one question in mind &amp;mdash; what can go wrong?

ðŸ’­ What can go wrong with this framework I am using?
ðŸ’­ What happens when something &amp;ldquo;goes wrong&amp;rdquo;? Do I have a fallback mechanism? Kill switch?
Sometimes I would even obsess over a single line of code written, thinking of all the ways that one line could break, trying to make it as bulletproof as possible.</description>
